# description
thm is a shell script that applies colors to a template file.

# usage
thm theme_name

the theme_name does not include the `.theme` at the end of the file.

# directories
By default, the config files will be searched for in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/thm` or `$HOME/.config/thm`.
The generated files will be placed in either `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/thm` or `$HOME/.cache/thm`. This can
be changed by setting the environment variables `THM_CONFIG_DIR` and `THM_DEST_DIR`. The dest dir
is cleared while running.

# inside config directory
The themes directory holds shell scripts defining the colors. These files should end with `.theme`
if they should be usable with thm. The templates directory holds files for generating the themes.
These files should end with `.template` The scripts directory holds files to be executed after thm
is finished generating all the files. These files should be executable in order for thm to launch
them. Examples of these files can be found in the examples directory of this repository.
